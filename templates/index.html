            In Singapore, we can see that many MNCs (Tiktok, ByteDance, Shopee), as well as the public sector(CSIT, NCS) are actively hiring, which could indicate a strong demand for people in the ICT industry.

              Singapore seems to favour more technical roles. There is a especially higher demand for Information Security roles (eg.

              In the US, there is a large emphasis on programming languages, specifically Java, SQL & Javascript. While these programming languages appear in Singapore, the chart shows that the region focuses more on broad categories like Software, Cloud, Web, rather than the breakdown of specific languages.
            </li>
            <li>
              This could imply that the US has a strong demand for developers with expertise in specific languages. While Singapore, a newer economy, might require developers to be more dynamic. With a larger focus on cloud technologies rather than traditional programming stacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Singapore, <b>Project Management Skills</b> are more emphasised. This could be due to Singaporean companies having fast-paced environments requiring cross-functional collaboration and iterative development.

              Singapore seeks for strong project management skills(Leadership, communication), which could indicate a rising demand for IS professionals in managerial/consultant roles
